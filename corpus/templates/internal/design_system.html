    <h1>Welcome to the Design System</h1>
    <p>
        This is a brief about the design system used in Corpus. It is powered by <a
            href="https://daisyui.com/">DaisyUI</a>, which is built on top of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind
            CSS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While developing interfaces for Corpus, remember to first consult this document. Most of the instructions about
        acceptable typography, colors and other styles will be provided here. There might be cases where your use-case
        has not been documented on this page. In that case, first refer to the DaisyUI component documentation, before
        working directly with the Tailwind CSS classes.
