Tailwind HTML File

This file will be used to reference classes that are used indirectly in HTML templates.
For example, we define CSS class names to be used in forms in the Python code.
Tailwind will not know to reference these classes unless we define them in a file that is included in a HTML template.

This file will never be referenced within Django, so feel free to add any classes that aren't referenced in HTML here.

<p class="mt-1 w-full rounded-md shadow-sm"></p>
<p class="input input-bordered focus:input-primary"></p>
<p class="checkbox checkbox-primary"></p>
<p class="radio radio-primary"></p>
<p class="select select-bordered focus:select-primary"></p>
